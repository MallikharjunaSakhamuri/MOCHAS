# MOCHAS

These codes files are to calculate the differential of a given equation and the solve them using the given model parameters for the MOCHAS project - Unconstrained exponential population gowth (exponential change models). 
When the derivative curve is equal to zero, the original function must be at a critical point, that is, the curve is changing from increasing to decreasing or visa versa.
